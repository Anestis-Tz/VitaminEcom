# Vitamins E Commerce Website

This web page is a project that I had to complete in the Web Applications class in my University.

It's a simple E-Shop that sells Vitamins
It contains:
  •A main landing page where several items based on their popularity are being showcased.
  •An item description page where the buyer can inspect the item he clicked.
  •A seller dashboard where sellers can create a seller account and have the rights to list their products to be published and bought.
  •A cart where the buyer can proceed and place an order on a given item.
  •A registration form where the user can choose to create an account as a seller/buyer.
